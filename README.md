Note: Some of the textbooks and resources here are not "required" or necessarily recommended/vetted by a particular subject's professor.
Sometimes I add resources that I've come across during my own studies.
Additionally, some resources are lifted from Anna's Archive.That website has long download times so its best to pull from here if possible.
If your textbook cannot be found, there's a good chance it's on [Anna's Archive](https://annas-archive.org/). They scrape all the public libraries like libgen and dokumen.pub.
