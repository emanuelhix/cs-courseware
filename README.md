Note: The textbooks and resources listed here are not always "required" or officially recommended by the course professor. I may include materials I've discovered during my own studies, as well as some sourced from Anna's Archive. Please be aware that download times from Anna's Archive can be quite long, so it's best to use the resources available here when possible. If you canâ€™t find a specific textbook, it's likely available on [Anna's Archive](https://annas-archive.org/), which aggregates content from public libraries like LibGen and Dokumen.pub.
